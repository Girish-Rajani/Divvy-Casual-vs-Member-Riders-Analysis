# Divvy-Casual-vs-Member-Riders-Analysis
The purpose of this notebook is to conduct an analysis for the Google Data Analysis Capstone Project on Coursera. In this case study I was provided data from a bike-share company called Divvy. In order to answer the key business questions, I will follow the steps of the Data Analysis Process: Act, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share and Act.

## The Business Task

Analyze riding patterns from the 2023 Divvy trip data to understand how casual vs member riders use Divvy bikes differently.

## Description of Data Sources Used

I used twelve-months of historical Divvy trip dataset to perform this analysis. This includes twelve different files each containing a month of data ranging from Jan 2023 - Dec 2023. The data is public and has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this License.
